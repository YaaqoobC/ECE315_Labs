Part 1:
- Was attempting to assert if the q_tx was intialized it was not 
    - Fixed it by initializeing the queue for q_tx

- URT_RX was missing delay (busy waiting)
    - not good since it hogs cpu

- Fixed UART_TX by updating the xTicksToWait from 0FFFFF to 0
    - blocking calls are not appropriate cuz they hold the CPU

- Explain why routing through the driver is important
- LOOK AT PAGE 7
